The browser-specific tags kept coming, and it became increasingly apparent that a 
standard needed to be found. To this end, the » World Wide Web Consortium (abbrevia
ted to the W3C) was founded in 1994 to standardise the language and keep it 
evolving in the right direction. Their first work was code-named WILBUR, and later
 became known as » HTML 3.2. This was a toned-down change to the existing standards
, leaving many of the big steps forward for later versions. Most of the extensions 
tags that had been introduced by Netscape (and to a lesser-extent, Microsoft) did 
not make it into these new standards. It soon caught on and became the official 
standard in January ’97, and today practically all browsers support it fully.

HTML 4.0 was recommended by the W3C in December ’97 and became the official standar
d in April 1998. Browser support was undertaken surprisingly earnestly by Microsoft
 in their Internet Explorer browser, and the market-leading IE5 (and current succes
sor IE6) have excellent support for almost all of the new tags and attributes. In 
comparison, Netscape’s terribly flawed Navigator 4.7 was inept when it came to HTML
 4.0 and even basic CSS. Modern browsers however, are a vast improvement.

<b><font face ="Century Gothic" size=4 color="blue"><u>XHTML 1.0</u></font></b><br>

Close to the beginning of the 21st century the W3C issued their » specifications 
of XHTML 1.0 as a recommendation. Since January 26, 2000 it stands as the joint-
standard with HTML 4.01. XHTML marks a departure from the way new specs have worked
 — it is an entirely new branch of HTML, incorporating the rigours of » XML, so 
that code must be properly written if it is to work once it reaches the reader’s 
browser. There weren’t many new or deprecated tags and attributes in XHTML, but 
some things changed with a view of increased accessibility and functionality. It’s
 mainly just a new set of coding rules. <br><br>

After HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0, the guys who were in control of HTML’s direction got
 sidetracked working on a new proposal for XHTML 2. At the same time, clever web 
developers were innovating constantly, hacking new functionality into websites and 
browsers. The path that XHTML 2 was taking started to look both boring and
 unrealistic, and it became pretty clear that a new approach was needed.
It was around this time that a bunch of pragmatic web technology fans, browser
 programmers and specification writers started building something of their own, out
side of the usual W3C procedures. They called themselves the Web Hypertext
 Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), and developed a new spec. After
 some soul-searching, the W3C decided that HTML was still the future of the web. 
XHTML 2 was discontinued and HTML5 became the new specification that everyone’s 
effort should be poured into.

HTML5 is designed for the web, both now and in the future. This is the specificatio
n that we will be working with for the next decade at least, so the process of its 
development is relatively slow and considered. Many parts will be familiar, but the
re’s also plenty of new elements, attributes and abilities to get excited about. 
You can check the latest version of the spec if you want all the detail. A full 
tutorial on HTML Source about the changes in HTML5 is forthcoming.
