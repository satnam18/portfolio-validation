HISTORY OF HTML </u></font></b>

<font face ="Century Gothic" size=3 >
HTML 1.0 was the 1<sup>st</sup> release of HTML to the world. Not many people were involved 
in website creation at the time, and the language was very limiting. There really 
wasn’t much you could do with it bar getting some simple text onto the web. But 
then, just that got the beardos a-foamin’ back in the day.

<font face ="Century Gothic" size=3 >
HTML 2.0 included everything from the original 1.0 specifications but added a few 
new features to the mix. » HTML 2.0 was the standard for website design until 
January 1997 and defined many core HTML features for the first time.

<b><font face ="Century Gothic" size=4 color="blue"><u>HTML 3.0</u></font></b><br>
<font face ="Century Gothic" size=3 >Dave Raggett introduced a new HTML draft, 
HTML 3.0. It included many new and improved abilities for HTML, and promised far 
more powerful opportunities for webmasters to design their pages. Sadly, the 
browsers were awfully slow in implementing any of the new improvements, only adding
 in a few and leaving out the rest. Partly, this failure can be attributed to the 
size of the overhaul; and so the HTML 3.0 spec was abandoned.
